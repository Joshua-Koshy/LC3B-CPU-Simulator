# LC-3b Instruction-Level Simulator

This folder provides an instruction-level simulator for the LC-3b architecture.  
It directly executes machine-code files, modelling each instruction in turn and allowing tracing and inspection of the architectural state.

## Features
- Loads object files generated by the assembler (Lab1) and simulates each instruction one at a time. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- Maintains PC, register file (R0–R7), and condition codes (N, Z, P) accurately. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
- Supports debugging operations: single-step execution, state dumping, memory/register inspection.  
- Lightweight, clear architecture that enables further enhancements later.

## Usage
```bash
./lc3b_instr_sim program.obj
